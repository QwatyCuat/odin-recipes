    <h3>You will look like this when you eat this Coffee Jelly.</h3>
    <p>This week, we're headed into hotly-requested-but-I'm-not-familiar-with-the-source-material territory with The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. Our titular hero has a particular affinity for caffeine in jiggle-form, and with the help of a bevy of coffee gadgetry, we'll bring this wiggling summertime treat to life.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup of espresso</li>
        <li>1 & 1/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons of agar agar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the whipped cream</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cream</li>
        <li>1-2 Tbsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make 2/3 cup of espresso.</li>
        <li>Add 1 ⅓ cup of water, 1 ½ teaspoons (or half a packet) of agar agar, and ¼ cup of sugar into a medium saucepan. Tiny whisk agar agar and sugar to dissolve until no crystals remain. Turn off heat and allow to cool for about 5 minutes before adding ⅔ cup of espresso to the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Taste for sweetness and adjust accordingly before ladling into desired serving vessels. Place vessels into fridge for around an hour, depending on size, until jelly-like. If placing into a different vessel, loosen around edges with a knife, and invert onto the new vessel. </li>
        <li>Make whipped cream by mixing about a cup of cream with a tablespoon or two of sugar. Mix until you see stiff peaks or big chunks and drop into pastry bag with a decorative tip. Squeeze whipped cream onto coffee jelly in a fun pattern.</li>
    </ol>
